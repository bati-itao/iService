<h2>Information and Awareness on Accessibility Topics</h2>
<p>The IT Accessibility Office offers awareness services. We provide information on accessibility related matters.</p>
<p>The term "hearing impaired" describes people with any degree of hearing loss. This ranges from hard of hearing to complete deafness.</p>
<h3>Definition of various levels of hearing loss</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-0">
<dt>Deaf:</dt>
<dd>refers to a person with hearing loss so severe that there is very little or no functional hearing.</dd>
<dt>Deafened:</dt>
<dd>usually refers to a person who becomes deaf as an adult.</dd>
<dt>Hard-of-hearing:</dt>
<dd>refers to a person with hearing loss where there may be enough residual hearing that an auditory device, such as a hearing aid or a frequency-modulation system, provides adequate assistance to process speech.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some people also may have overly sensitive hearing (Hyperacusis) in one or both ears.</p>
<h2>Client's Need Assessment of Adaptive Technology (AT)</h2>
<p>The IT Accessibility Office offers insight and guidance in meeting the needs for those who are hearing impaired. By developing a strategy suited to individual needs, we can determine the best adaptive technology (AT) to be made available for client use.</p>
<h2>General Requests for Adaptive Technology (AT)</h2>
<p>You may submit a general inquiry. The IT Accessibility Office is dedicated to respond to general requests for adaptive Technology (AT).</p>
