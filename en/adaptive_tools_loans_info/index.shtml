<h2>Mobility / Dexterity</h2>
<p>Mobility/dexterity impairments range from problems stemming from musculoskeletal disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome or back pain, to little or no use of one or both hands. Individuals with these impairments may require special devices to use computer equipment, including modified keyboards, on-screen keyboards or a head or foot mouse. They may also need to use word prediction or voice recognition systems to help them type.</p>

<h2>Cognition</h2>
<p>Cognitive impairments take many forms, including short and long-term memory impairments, and perceptual differences. Language impairments, including dyslexia and temporary impairments associated with those attempting to learn new languages, are also common cognitive problems. Normally a combination of adaptive computer technologies is used to help people with cognition problems.</p>
