<h2>Information and Awareness on Accessibility Topics</h2>
<p>The IT Accessibility Office offers awareness services. We provide information on accessibility related matters.</p>
<p>A mobility impairment is defined as any disability that restricts a person's motor functioning skills. A dexterity impairment affects an individual's ability to make precise movements with one's hands, as in writing and keyboarding. Individuals with these impairments may require special devices to use computer equipment, including modified keyboards, on-screen keyboards, or a head or foot mouse.</p>
<h2>Client's Need Assessment of Adaptive Technology (AT)</h2>
<p>The IT Accessibility Office offers insight and guidance in meeting the needs for those who have mobility and/or dexterity impairments. By developing a strategy suited to individual needs, we can determine the best adaptive technology (AT) to be made available for client use.</p>
